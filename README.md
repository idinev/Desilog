Desilog HDL


https://github.com/idinev/Desilog

An attempt to make a serious HDL, that avoids inferring of data-storage kind (register/wire/latch), and other pitfalls that I know of. 
It's planned to be a front-end to VHDL, and later be able to compile into a simulator without transcoding to VHDL. 



Desilog was known to my employer as my pet-project "IHDL", which I have permission to publish online. 
Written in and inspired by Dlang.
